Official Implementation of the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197224">paper</a>  published in *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems Volume: 39, Issue: 2, March 2024* 

## ðŸ“– Implementation:

- Install the packages in requirement.txt
- The demo.py shows how to apply the proposed model for load forecasting, to run this demo:
  - download file '2012-2013 Solar home electricity data v2.csv' from ausgrid resident dataset
  - run demo.py
  
## ðŸŒŸ Dataset:

 3 publicly available residential load datasets are applied:
- *[Ausgrid Resident](https://github.com/pierre-haessig/ausgrid-solar-data?tab=readme-ov-file#:~:text=Personal%20repository%20on%20the%20analysis%20of%20the%20Solar%20home%20electricity)*: Loads of 300 households in the Australian distribution network are released for public utilization.
- *[UMass Smart](https://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Smart/Smart)*: Multiple smart metersâ€™ readings
of 7 homes are collected by the UMass Smart Home project in America from 2014 to 2016.
- *[SGSC Customer Trial](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/smart-grid-smart-city-customer-trial-data)*: This dataset stems from the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project in Australia since 2010.
