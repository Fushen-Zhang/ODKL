A deep kernel is proposed by integrating the deep soft Spiking Neural Networks, which is then applied to
perform Gaussian Process (GP) regression. The constructed regressor investigates the temporal dynamics within the time-series and retains the probabilistic advantages for uncertainty estimates.

## ðŸŒŸ Dataset:

3 publicly available residential load datasets are applied:\
*[Ausgrid Resident](https://www.ausgrid.com.au/Industry/Our-Research/Data-to-share/Solar-home-electricity-data)*: Loads of 300 households in the Australian distribution network are released for public utilization.\
*[UMass Smart](https://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Smart/Smart)*: Multiple smart metersâ€™ readings
of 7 homes are collected by the UMass Smart Home project in America from 2014 to 2016.\
*[SGSC Customer Trial](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/smart-grid-smart-city-customer-trial-data): This dataset stems from the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project in Australia since 2010.*

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation:
- Install the packages in requirement.txt to run the code.
- The demo.py shows how to apply the proposed model for load forecasting.
